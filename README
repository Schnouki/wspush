Command wspush implements http service relaying redis pubsub messages to
websocket connections.

wspush subscribes to redis channel(s) using "PSUBSCRIBE prefix*" command
where prefix can be set with -prefix flag. When it receives a message
published to "prefixFoo" channel, it looks up any connected client(s) with
query string parameter "token=Foo" and sends message to each client as a
single websocket binary frame.
